## Project Structure

The project is a monorepo created with [turbo](https://turbo.build/repo). It consists of a cypress plugin and a web application.
The cypress plugin collects the following information about test execution: 
- the steps performed by cypress
- the DOM mutation caused by cypress instuctions
- network records caused by navigation or requests and console logs that ocurred in the browser durring the test.

The information is written to a file with the following signature `dump/{filename}.raw.json`.

### Folder structure:

- `packages/cypress-debugger` - the plugin entry point. It exports the `debuggerSupport` and `debuggerPlugin` functions, required for plugin installation and a set of types used in the web application.

- `packages/support` - exports the function that attaches handlers to [Cypress Events](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/catalog-of-events). Here are made the following actions:
            - collect cypress events
            - collect [rrweb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rrweb) events and match them with rrweb events
            - recording network events (using the [HAR generator cypress plugin](https://github.com/NeuraLegion/cypress-har-generator))

- `packages/plugin` - exports a function that attaches [Cypress Plugin Events](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/writing-a-plugin) handlers used inside the `setupNodeEvents` function of the cypress configuration. Here are collected the browser logs, and created the files with the collected information.
The browser logs are accessed using the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) by connecting to the cypress browser using the remote debugging port.
The result files are created in the `dump` folder relative to the cypress config file.
- `apps/web` - the web application.
The Web application is a basic UI created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It is a tool that helps to analyze the information from the files generated by the plugin. It also serves as an example for plugin integration.
- `packages/eslint-config-custom` - shared [eslint](https://eslint.org/) configuration.

- `packages/tsconfig` - shared [tsconfig](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html).
